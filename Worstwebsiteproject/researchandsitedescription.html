    <p> For my website, I want to convey the feeling of chaos by employing a series of animated gifs on each side of the screen. I've always hated the animated advertisements that are left taunting at you on the sides, which inspired me to insert rows and rows of ridiculous looking gifs that fit my theme. I kept the main focus of the website relatively empty for an uncomfortable contrast to all the chaotic activity. The background colors of the different pages are also very obnoxious and hard to look at (though the inpage is not the case it is still ugly). Finally, I included certain elements which interrupt the flow of the page and make things unsatisfying to look at.</p>
